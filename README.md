# Lesson 4.7: Integration with Frontend Components

For Lesson 4.7, you will be building upon the work you completed in Lesson 4.6. Let's integrate the Pets route and controller into your frontend.

## Tasks:

### 1. Update `app.js`
- **Fetch All Pets**: Implement a function that makes an API call to fetch all pets from the backend.
- **Add New Pet**: Create another function that allows adding a new pet to the database through an API call.

### 2. Develop Frontend Components
- **Display Pets Component**: Develop a component that:
    - Fetches and displays the list of all pets using the function you created in `app.js`.
    - Presents the pets in a user-friendly format.

- **Add Pet Component**: Create a component that:
    - Provides input fields for the user to enter new pet details (e.g., name, type).
    - On submission, the details should be sent to the backend using the function in `app.js` to add the new pet to the database.

**Note**: Ensure all components effectively communicate with the routes and controller you established in Lesson 4.6. Proper error handling and user feedback are also essential for a smooth user experience.

Happy coding!
